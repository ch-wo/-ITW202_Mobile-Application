    <string name="Textscroll">Alibaba Group Holding Limited, also known as Alibaba Group and as Alibaba.com,
        is a Chinese multinational technology company specializing in e-commerce, retail, Internet, and technology.
        Founded on 28 June 1999 in Hangzhou, Zhejiang, the company provides consumer-to-consumer (C2C), business-to-consumer (B2C),
        and business-to-business (B2B) sales services via web portals, as well as electronic payment services, shopping search
        engines and cloud computing services. It owns and operates a diverse portfolio of companies around the world in numerous
        business sectors. On 19 September 2014, Alibaba initial public offering (IPO) raised US$25 billion, giving the company
        a market value of US$231 billion and, by far, then the largest IPO in world history. It is one of the top 10 most
        valuable corporations, and is named the 31st-largest public company in the world on the Forbes Global 2000 2020 list.
        In January 2018, Alibaba became the second Asian company to break the US$500 billion valuation mark, after its competitor
        Tencent. As of 2020, Alibaba has the sixth-highest global brand valuation. Alibaba is one of the world largest retailers
        and e-commerce companies. In 2020, it was also rated as the fifth-largest artificial intelligence company.
        It is also one of the biggest venture capital firms, and one of the biggest investment corporations in the world.
        The company hosts the largest B2B (Alibaba.com), C2C (Taobao), and B2C (Tmall) marketplaces in the world.
        It has been expanding into the media industry, with revenues rising by triple percentage points year after year.
        It also set the record on the 2018 edition of China Singles Day, the world biggest online and offline shopping day.
        On 28 June 1999,[1] Jack Ma and 17 friends and students founded Alibaba.com, a China-based B2B marketplace site,
        in his Hangzhou apartment.
        In October 1999, Alibaba received a US$25 million investment from Goldman Sachs and SoftBank.
        Alibaba.com was expected to improve the domestic e-commerce market and perfect an e-commerce platform for Chinese enterprises,
        especially small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), to help export Chinese products to the global market as well as address
        World Trade Organization (WTO) challenges. In 2002, Alibaba.com became profitable three years after launch. Ma wanted to improve
        the global e-commerce system, so from 2003 onward, Alibaba launched Taobao Marketplace, Alipay, Alimama.com, and Lynx.
        When eBay announced its expansion into China in 2003, Ma viewed the American company as a foreign competitor and rejected eBay
        buyout of Alibaba subsidiary Taobao. Through applying existing technologies and gaining trust in the Chinese e-commerce market,
        as well as expanding through dominating the market at a loss before making a return on additional services, Alibaba subsidiaries
        outperformed eBay in the Chinese e-commerce market, claiming a growing percentage of consumers from eBay. Alibaba subsidiary Taobao
        would later force eBay out of the Chinese market, with eBay closing its unprofitable China Web unit, though the two companies would
        break even six years later. In 2005, Yahoo! invested in Alibaba through a variable interest entity (VIE) structure, buying a 40%
        stake in the company for US$1 billion.This would as a result net in US$10 billion in Alibaba\'s IPO alone to Yahoo!.</string>
